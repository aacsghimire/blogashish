Being in the centre may help us in some cases, in others we have to trade very carefully. When the Major country like USA and our own neighbor India are standing up against China we kinda have to shut up."

# Why it is Impossible for Nepal to Ban TikTok?

India banned Tiktok a while ago due to privacy concern now USA is following Suit.

It is known to the world India is not a friendly country with China and it will take steps against China even if there’s a tiny chance it’s gonna hurt it.

Now USA and India share love of China Equally, it is a little difficult task for USA than to India.

# WHY?

India is more aligned towards dictatorship, that means Government can take action without real approvement from public. If you didn’t know recently many well known VPNs who were forced to leave the country. Reason: They will not share user data with government. This is story for another time. However you can find more info on this [Nord VPN Blog](https://nordvpn.com/blog/indian-servers-removal/)

As in USA They are Powerful and Bigger Control Freak but they have to do things subtly so they can preach other country and do things in name of FREEDOM so they are collecting proofs and working their way to convince public, which in my opinion is justified this time. SO its getting Banned.

# TikTok: Policy in China

China has a similar policy but in more strict way. Any data collected from users must be shared with Government. China is explicit about this and is not afraid to fight against International policies. Hence big companies like Google are not there and the biggest company is Tencent.

# NEPAL:

We The Poor People.

Geographically located between 2 major countries which are so different with each others, we have to rely on mercy of others to stay alive. We always have to make these both country happy or somewhat uninterested with us.

We with our Gorkhali bravery are so innocent we do not realise how Countries do not have to rely on physical resources to control us. It takes mere 10 staffs in a country of Billions people to handle us. We still think PsyOP is conspiracy. When even Big nations Literally confessed. Don’t get me wrong, its for the best. We do not want to raise alarm and turn the giants against us.

## Summary
Now lets get back to Tiktok, as much as its cringe its a PsyOP at its best, its not even intended against us and we are collateral.
Banning Tiktok is a direct step against China and we do not want to do that.
To a Nation ran by Bollywood and TV serials to PUBG and Tiktok. Its best for us to be stay illiteral for now.
