Let's see how many account do you have in the internet? Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, Twitter, <mark>Bank Account</mark>. Ah yeah Bank Account, do you use same password for everything or maybe multiple accounts, same password from last year, or the year you created it. or You never even changed that 2010 password you created and now its your default. That my friend is a Red Flag. ðŸš©ðŸš©
Look, I am aware, internet security seems like a big deal to manage. But let me tell you a secret _Idea is not to the easiest target_. That's all it is. You don't want to be victim by some kid who watched a 10 minute Youtube video. So you my friend don't have to be SMART all you have to be is Wiser.
And who is wiser than the one who don't only protect his past but also his future, right? RIGHT?
Alright, let's get into it.

## Make your Password Complicated

Think of a book that has every word in English language, does it even exist? Everything? EVERYTHING? Well, it does its called >! Dictionary. A normal dictionary with 600,000 words would be 250MB. If you look for a big wordlists in google today you can download almost 45 GB of it. Point is, its not just dictionary terms that are vulnerable today but mixtures of letters, numbers and symbols too. I mean you don't want to put '_Passw0rd_ or _Pa$$w0rd_' as your password, the hackers are smart enough to keep those terms in the wordlists. Not just that, Through the years, with so many breaches, we have collected a huge database of passwords around the world. Real world passwords used in real life. So there we have it a big book of passwords. Oh also these breaches do have id's tied to them. There's a good chance you'd find your id with your password next to it. But don't worry yet if you chose a strong password or haven't been a victim of breach you'd be safe.
Here, let's go to a site that tells us if our password is secure or not or your username/email. Go to [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com), type your email and see what it says.

Look at That. I am safe, are you?
Now next Step!

We have established we are not going to use weak password. Now what?
Now we create strong passwords or pass phrases or pass-novels. You got the point. Make a word or sentence no one will guess, not one but for each site you have account with and remember it? And in comes Password Manager.

## Password Manager

A password manager is something that saves your Password. That's all it is. There is more features to it but that's its main feature. It _saves_ your password.
The other important feature to it is to create one. Your device whether Apple, Android or your PC browser, already comes with password mananger. Remember when you go to a site and the id and passwords are saved there? and everytime you use username and password in new site, there's that annoying popup asking you to save your password. Yeah, that's password manager.
Even google and saves your passwords. For google go to [passwords.google.com](https://passwords.google.com). Sign in and there are your passwords saved in google.
<!-- ### Why save your password?

A human brain can only handle so many phrases, especially, complicated ones. My sibling resets password everytime they have to use it. -->
