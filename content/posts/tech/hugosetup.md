Alright I wanted to lecture you but that's not my forte. You should decide whether you want to write a *blog* or not. I surely can tell you advantages of it for you and for your audience:

- *You* can share your thoughts and Knowledge freely without boundary and without loosing chain of thoughts.
- *You* definately will increase your writing and story telling skills.
- *You* can make your voice heard without being lost on the crowd.
- *You* will be an independent creator, artist, writer, story teller, or Journalist.
- *You* can even start your own business, where you invite different writers.
- *You* can generate revenue through google ads.

> It's all FREE and Easy

 If you can follow guide.

- *We* as your Audience can keep tabs and learn what you're good at.
- *We* can learn a new skill that we didn't even know was possible.

Alright that's all i got for why.

## Let's focus on **HOW**

---
In order to start a new website you are going to need few things. I know it sounds scary at first but trust me, following this guide, you'll setup a site for yourself and don't even have to bother remembering one step after 10 minutes. This is going to be a little technical though, just a little.

## Things you Need

---
You have to install following softwares and make account on websites.

### Softwares

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- A text Editor: [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Accounts

- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/)

### Domain Name

- [Register.com.np](https://register.com.np/)

You are going to need to install the given softwares. I am going to explain but you can skip this part if you just want a blog and don't want to worry about technical Jargon.

- *Hugo* is a static Site Generator. It means  it is going to generate all the files that your website needs to run on the internet, things that will make your website functional and pretty.
- *Github* is somewhere where we Keep our files of our Website.
- *Cloudflare* is a big one. This not only Secures your site but will handle all the Technical side of your website. What we really need is 3 functions:
  - Create *SSL* so you have HTTPS.
  - *CDN: Content Delivery Network* : So your website loads in an instant from any part of the world.
  - *Pages* takes your file from Github and Builds a proper website. Also called *Hosting*
  - *Email* is optional but awesome feature. It let's you create your own email router. for example you can contact me at contact@ashishghimire.com this is possible by cloudflare. When you send me email on that address it forwards it to my Gmail. This way its easier for me to know where i got mail from. You can send me a mail and let me know if this helped you. ðŸ˜‰
- *VScode* main function of Vscode will be to write our content but It will also help us to upload our site on Github.
- *Domain Name* to get free .com.np domain in Nepal. You have to register at [Register.com.np](https://register.com.np).
